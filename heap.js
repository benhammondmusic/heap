A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node. 
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored at index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

How is Min Heap represented ? 
A Min Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Min heap is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0]. For any ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:

Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.
Operations on Min Heap : 

peek()/getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
pop()/extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
